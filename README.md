# TimeTrackr — Frontend

This repository contains a frontend scaffold for TimeTrackr — a modern time and task tracking UI built with React and Vite.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- Uses React + Vite. Charts use Chart.js via react-chartjs-2.
- Theme can be toggled in the top-right; it persists in localStorage.
- Tasks page includes per-task timers (stateful, client-only) and an Add/Edit modal.

Next steps and possible improvements

- Integrate with backend API for auth, tasks, and real data.
- Persist tasks to localStorage or remote DB.
- Add unit tests and e2e tests.
